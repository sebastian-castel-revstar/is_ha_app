      <h2>Task Overview</h2>
      <p>Your task is to identify toxic content in user queries by selecting all applicable categories. A query may have multiple labels or none at all.</p>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Read</strong> the entire query carefully.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider</strong> each category independently - a query can fit multiple categories.</li>
        <li><strong>Select</strong> all applicable labels.</li>
        <li><strong>Review</strong> your choices before submitting.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Category Definitions & Examples</h2>

      <h3>Toxic</h3>
      <p>Rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable content that might discourage further discussion.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✓ "your customer service is garbage"</li>
        <li>✓ "only idiots would stay at this hotel"</li>
        <li>✗ "I was disappointed with my stay"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Severe Toxicity</h3>
      <p>Extremely hateful, aggressive, or disrespectful content that would very likely end discussion.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✓ "I will make sure everyone knows how **** terrible you are"</li>
        <li>✓ "absolute scam artists who deserve to go bankrupt"</li>
        <li>✗ "this is ridiculous service"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Obscene</h3>
      <p>Vulgar or explicit language.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✓ [queries with explicit profanity]</li>
        <li>✓ [queries with vulgar references]</li>
        <li>✗ "this sucks"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Threat</h3>
      <p>Content threatening violence or harm.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✓ "I'm going to come there and make you regret this"</li>
        <li>✓ "you'll be sorry when I'm done with you"</li>
        <li>✗ "I will never stay here again"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Insult</h3>
      <p>Direct insults toward staff, brand, or other users.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✓ "your staff are incompetent morons"</li>
        <li>✓ "worst hotel chain run by clueless people"</li>
        <li>✗ "the service was poor"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Identity Attack</h3>
      <p>Attacks based on race, gender, religion, or other aspects of identity.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✓ [discriminatory comments about staff or guests]</li>
        <li>✓ [prejudiced remarks about specific groups]</li>
        <li>✗ "the staff were unfriendly"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Important Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Focus on the content, not the tone</li>
        <li>Criticism alone is not toxic</li>
        <li>Bad reviews are not automatically toxic</li>
        <li>Multiple categories can apply to one query</li>
      </ul>
    </full-instructions>
