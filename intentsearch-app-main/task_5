Ticket 5: Create us-west-2 infrastructure for SageMaker endpoints (IAM, VPC, KMS, autoscaling)

Priority: High | Dependencies: None (can run in parallel with Ticket 3) | Assignee: AP Description: Create and verify infrastructure prerequisites in us-west-2 for hosting IS SageMaker endpoints: IAM roles, VPC/subnets/security groups, KMS keys, and autoscaling configuration. Current state:

· h-sagemaker-crossaccountrole exists (global IAM role) but needs policy review for multi-region

· NER model uses VPC config in us-east-1; equivalent VPC resources needed in us-west-2

· MRK KMS keys exist in both regions

· No autoscaling configured for IS endpoints in either region

Acceptance criteria:

· SageMaker execution role policies verified/updated for us-west-2 support

· VPC subnets and security groups identified/created in us-west-2 matching DS patterns

· KMS keys (MRKs) confirmed available for SageMaker encryption in us-west-2

· Autoscaling policies designed and ready to apply (if needed)

· Infrastructure documented and codified in Terraform

Questions part 1:

1.Where exactly in the repository should I add the Terraform code for us-west-2? Should I create a new folder for this region or use an existing module? I'm asking because I have previously only worked with CloudFormation in this repo.
2.For the h-sagemaker-crossaccountrole, should we update the existing global policy to include us-west-2 resources, or should I create a new region-specific policy?
3. Do we have specific target metrics for autoscaling? For example, should I use SageMakerVariantInvocationsPerInstance or focus on CPU/Memory utilization?
4. Could you provide the ARNs or Aliases of the MRK KMS keys for us-west-2 so I can reference them correctly in the code?
