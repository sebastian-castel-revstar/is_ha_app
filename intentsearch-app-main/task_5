Ticket 5: Create us-west-2 infrastructure for SageMaker endpoints (IAM, VPC, KMS, autoscaling)

Priority: High | Dependencies: None (can run in parallel with Ticket 3) | Assignee: AP Description: Create and verify infrastructure prerequisites in us-west-2 for hosting IS SageMaker endpoints: IAM roles, VPC/subnets/security groups, KMS keys, and autoscaling configuration. Current state:

· h-sagemaker-crossaccountrole exists (global IAM role) but needs policy review for multi-region

· NER model uses VPC config in us-east-1; equivalent VPC resources needed in us-west-2

· MRK KMS keys exist in both regions

· No autoscaling configured for IS endpoints in either region

Acceptance criteria:

· SageMaker execution role policies verified/updated for us-west-2 support

· VPC subnets and security groups identified/created in us-west-2 matching DS patterns

· KMS keys (MRKs) confirmed available for SageMaker encryption in us-west-2

· Autoscaling policies designed and ready to apply (if needed)

· Infrastructure documented and codified in Terraform
